            <p>The <strong>Book of Mormon</strong> is the dividing religious text which serves as the cultural distinctive feature of several Christian Reformist groups. These groups rage from ~16m to ~100 people. The Book of Mormon, written by reformation prophet Joseph Smith Jr., provides the basis for the idea of continuous revelation. This concept is known as <strong>Continuationism</strong>.<sup> <a href="https://www.theopedia.com/continuationism">[1]</a> </sup> The <strong>Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints</strong>, otherwise known as LDS or Brighamites, claims within its 8th Article of Faith that the Book of Mormon is similar to the Bible by being the word of God.</p><p></p><p><em>"We believe the Bible to be the word of God as far as it is translated correctly; we also believe the Book of Mormon to be the word of God."</em><sup> <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/a-of-f/1?lang=eng">[2]</a> </sup></p><p></p>

            <p></p><h2>A God of Stability, not Confusion</h2><hr><p>God has designed his universe  in such a way that his expression of himself does not induce confusion among his doctrine. This does not in any way disregard contention between faiths  which focus on secondary and tertiary issues which are not  issues of contradiction. God lays his words out and our interpretation may differ, however, he will never clearly contradict himself. 1st Corinthians 14:33 explains that God does not author confusion. </p><p></p><p><em>"For God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as in all churches of the saints. (KJV)"</em><sup> <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%2014%3A33&version=KJV">[3]</a> </sup></p><p></p><p>God does not offer unto his children two diverging ideas, rather it is his children who fail to correctly determine the words of God. There are numerous contradictions directly between the Bible and the Book of Mormon which fundamentally alter their corresponding theology. Many LDS believers will claim this is the Church evolving, however, a Church is not meant to evolve through their texts but through their proper understanding of the text. This idea is in Psalm 102:11-12.</p><p></p><p><em>"My days are like the evening shadow; I wither away like grass. [12] But you, Lord, sit enthroned forever; your renown endures through all generations. (KJV)</em>"<sup> <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%20102%3A11-12&version=NIV">[4]</a> </sup></p><p></p><p>God, and in relation his words, endure forever while man, and the creation of man, are fleeting like unto the evening shadow. This would, therefore, solidify the concept of an all encompassing, all knowing, and all certain.</p><p></p>

            <p></p><h2>Scriptural Contradiction</h2><hr><p></p><p>The Book of Mormon and the Bible contain several scriptural contradictions. This number is greatly expounded with the introduction of the <strong>Doctrine and Covenants</strong> or the <strong>D&C</strong>. On of the contradictions included is the dichotomy between Psalm 51:5 and 2nd Nephi 2:23-25.</p><p></p><p><em>"Behold, I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my mother conceive me. (KJV)"</em><sup> <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%2051%3A5&version=KJV">[5]</a> </sup></p><p></p><p><em>"Adam fell that men might be; and men are, that they might have joy. (BoM)"</em><sup> <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2?lang=eng">[6]</a> </sup></p><p></p><p>Within the expanded text, encompassing portions of 2nd Nephi from 22-25, it portrays the Fall of Adam as a inherently joyful event in which humanity can rejoice by our creation. This is completely contradictory from the concept of sin from the beginning from Adam as seen in Psalm 51:5. It clearly states that <em>"in my sin did my mother conceive me. (KJV)"</em><sup> <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%2051%3A5&version=KJV">[5]</a> </sup> proving that every human is born with original sin.</p><p></p><h3>Further Reading</h3><ul><li>Acts 17:26 vs. 2nd Nephi 5:21</li><li>Ephesians 2:1-5 vs. 2nd Nephi 25:23</li><li>Matthew 27:45 vs. Helaman 14:27</li></ul><p></p></div></div>
